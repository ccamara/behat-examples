This folder contains Behat tests for all the project's content types.

# Things to consider:

* Each content type should have its own content_type.feature file (where content_type is a placeholder for content type's real name)
* Each feature contains tests for permissions file names
* All tests have been labeled with CTypes tag for ease of testing purposes

# Instructions

* Copy content_typeXXX.feature file and rename it with content type's real name
* Edit your newly created file and add all the necessary fields
* Rename any @content-typeXXX tag with your content type's real name
